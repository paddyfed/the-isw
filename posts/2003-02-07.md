I have a few more scanned articles this week. One is an advert for Episode I which has its 'Premiere' on UTV tonight, even though it has already been on RTÃ‰. Anyway read it [here](rteguide_epiguide.jpg) with the photo [here](rteguide_quigonpic.jpg).

The second scan is of a USI (Union of Students in Ireland) leaflet for this years 'Grant' marches. It likens the Irish Government to the 'Evil Empire'. The full size poster in the college is quite funny also. Click [here](usi_poster.jpg) to see the leaflet.

The archives for November 2002 have been added.
