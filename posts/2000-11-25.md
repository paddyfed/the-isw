Well here in Ireland we are certainly getting into the Christmas spirit. It seems to come earlier and earlier every year. With this in mind I'd like to introduce you to the Christmas 2000 design for the site. I hope that you like it.

"The Muppet's Treasure Island" featuring Frank Oz was on RTÉ 1 today. Thanks to Tipplehilti for the report.

I have spotted the new Star Wars trilogy videos in Tescos price IR£24.99. Unfortunatly it wasn't the widescreen version which is what I'm looking for and the boxes weren't in the best condition. However the packaging does look cool. If you have wached the videos or if you've seen them anywhere else let us know what you thought.
