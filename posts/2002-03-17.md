Happy, St. Patrick's Day everybody.

GA Daemon, a member of an online gaming and RPG organisation recently contacted me concerning Star Wars game playing in Ireland. I said I didn't know if anyone is interested in playing online Star Wars games but I said I would pass on his URL anyway. www.imperialnexus.net. Check it out if you're interested.
