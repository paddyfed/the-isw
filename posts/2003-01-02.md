I know, I know I've been idle on the site for a month and I'm sorry about that. Things just kept getting in the way. Any way belated Merry Christmas and Happy 2003 to you all. I hope you all had a good one and looking forward to another Star Wars packed year.

In terms of the site, not much has happened. The trivia contest is over and Gabe has won again, however without anyone else entering. Still nevermind. I think I'll take a small break from the trivia for a while. It'll give me a bit of time to gather some more questions. Rest assured it will be back and quicker than the last break. There's also something important I need to ask you (ie those who participate in the trivia). More about that later though.
