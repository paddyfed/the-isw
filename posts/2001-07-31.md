I was going to put the pop-up ads on the site this week but judging by the response to the latest poll I think I'll wait awhile. However I do want peoples opinions. If we don't have the pop-up ads, why not and are there any other alternatives?

The site has also had a few changes in the background which should ensure faster loading (I hope).

July 2001 has been added to the archives.
