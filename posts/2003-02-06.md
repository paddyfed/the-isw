Just a quick note to tell you all that I'll change the poll whenever I get to college today, as well as the update for January 2003. Yes that's right it's February already. Ive also updated the links section. It's getting a bit scarce.

Dave from pixel Masher also e-mailed me about his Space Hopper Star Wars parody site which was already mentioned on GalacticEmpire.co.uk.
