DewbackWing are mainly concerned with creating props and costumes from Star Wars but they also have some RPG areas of the site. Check out the site here.",
      "As you know the Trivia competition has finished for a while again. Now I'm wondering, when I start the trivia competition again, should I start the Trivia Table from scratch again or should it be continued on from the last one? Or should I create a trivia table for the first five, the last five and the next five trivia competitions? Seeing as ye are the ones who participate in the Trivia competitions you should have your input on the subject. Just send us an e-mail.",
      "In other news my other web-site, PaddyFedoo ONLINE, (link may no longer be accessable) is having a bit of trouble. ProHosting who host the site are trying to make me pay for it and while it must be said it is a low enough sum I'm just not prepared to pay for the service which is at best, crap. So if you know of any FREE hosting sites out there with FTP support, let us know."
