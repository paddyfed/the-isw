Due to the lack of any big news on the EII front since principal photography was completed , the acronym at the tip of everybodies tongues at the minute is.......D.V.D.

Why?, because Lucasfilm insist that instead of releasing the goods now (they'd rather not cash in on 6 years interim revenue), they'll only release a 6 DVD box set in 2006 so packed full of extras and bonus footage you'll be mad not to get one.

I for one dont believe it.

Certain fans vigorously support Lucasfilm on their stance on DVD, but when have they ever missed an opportunity to earn more money?

The DVD editions will be no different then the special edition VHS trilogy - create an artificial shortage, then there will be a demand and then they'll release the films in new packaging and we'll all be very happy.

IMO, within the next 18 months they'll release the bare bones TPM DVD, and maybe the trilogy DVDs if we really go mad, of course we'll all buy them and we'll all buy the special edition DVDs in 2006, Lucasfilm will play good guys and claim they bowed to the demand from fans. It's almost too perfect.

We're all winners (including Lucas), oh.... except for the people who claim Lucasfilm are bastions of morality and have some integrity when it comes to cashing in on the fans who only want a measly bare bones DVD....

Thats not too much to ask....
